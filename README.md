# Distribution Lab â€” Normal Distribution & Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

An interactive **Streamlit app** to explore the **Normal distribution** and visualize the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** in action.

---

## Demo  
ðŸ‘‰ **[Live App](https://raptive-assignment-ds7u4sk28vqkqdvrekpzwa.streamlit.app/)**  

---

## Features
- Adjustable **Î¼ (mean)** and **Ïƒ (standard deviation)** with instant PDF/CDF updates  
- Probability shading: `P(a â‰¤ X â‰¤ b)`  
- CLT simulation: histogram of sample means vs. theoretical `N(Î¼, Ïƒ/âˆšn)`  
- Summary statistics: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis  
- Download simulated data as CSV
