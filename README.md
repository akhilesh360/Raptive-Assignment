# Statistical Distribution Explorer

An interactive Streamlit web app to visualize and understand common statistical distributions: Normal, Poisson, and Exponential.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive Controls**: Adjust distribution parameters (e.g., mean, standard deviation, lambda) using sliders.
*   **Multiple Distributions**: Choose between Normal, Poisson, and Exponential distributions.
*   **Visualizations**:
    *   Probability Density/Mass Function (PDF/PMF) plots.
    *   Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots.
*   **Interactive Demo**: A simulation of the Central Limit Theorem for the Normal distribution.
*   **Key Statistics**: View calculated mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
*   **Data Export**: Download a sample of generated data as a CSV file.
*   **Reproducibility**: Set a random seed to get the same results every time.
